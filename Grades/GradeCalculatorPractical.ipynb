    "2) Now that you have finished fixing the bugs, lets add some features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Your co-teacher sometimes gets angry and gives students who really push her buttons a negative grade on assignments. In parseFile add a check that if the grade is negative to add a 0 to the grades variable instead. Otherwise your principal will be upset. \"gradesNegative.txt\" has an example of negative grades.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) The letter grade calcualtion should be a function. Write a function called letterGrade that takes as input an integer and outputs a letter \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\". Update the program to use this function instead.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) You have a separate file of students who completed an extra credit assignment. If a student completed the extra credit you need to increase their grade by 2%. The file is called \"extra.txt\". Read this file in and see if the student's name appears on the list. If it does add 2% to their grade. The file format has each name on a new line like this:\n",

    "    d) *** Challenge *** Can you modify the program so that it can take a file that it can calculate all of the student's grades at once. There is a file called \"gradesAll.txt\" that has all of the students grades. The student's name comes first followed by all of their grades. Each student is separated by a blank line. See the following format:\n",
